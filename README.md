# Major Project Football Analysis

## *This project is a part of thesis for MSc Computer Science (Data Analytics) at NUI, Galway.* ##

**The base idea of the project is to use different cases of pitch division and ball possession in those regions. To find out**

1. The clusters of alike clubs in EPL on the basis of location of the game.
2. The clubs playing in any particular match using NN.
3. The cluster of a clubs in a match using NN and location of the game.


**Result Overview:**

1. Clustering gives us the baseline of how team are actually playing in the leauges.
2. It is hard to predict 20 teams with such a small data.
3. Finding cluster of a team for a given match, gives us good results for both the cases when pitch was divided into 3 areas and for 9 zones.
